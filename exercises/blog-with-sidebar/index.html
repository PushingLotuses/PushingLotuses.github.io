            <h1>Sacred Geometry</h1>

            <h4>By Robert Aura Freitag . Oct 31 2025</h4>
            <p>
                Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to 
                certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions.
                [1] It is associated with the belief of a divine creator of 
                the universal geometer. The geometry used in the design and 
                construction of religious structures such as churches, temples,
                mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has 
                sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also 
                to sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village 
                greens, pagodas and holy wells, Mandala Gardens and the 
                creation of religious and spiritual art.

                According to Stephen Skinner, the study of sacred geometry 
                has its roots in the study of nature, and the mathematical 
                principles at work therein.[5] Many forms observed in nature 
                can be related to geometry; for example, the chambered 
                nautilus grows at a constant rate and so its shell forms a 
                logarithmic spiral to accommodate that growth without changing 
                shape. Also, honeybees construct hexagonal cells to hold their 
                honey. These and other correspondences are sometimes 
                interpreted in terms of sacred geometry and considered to be 
                further proof of the natural significance of geometric forms.

            <h3>Representations in art and architecture</h3>
            <p>
                Geometric ratios, and geometric figures were often employed in 
                the designs of ancient Egyptian, ancient Indian, Greek and 
                Roman architecture. Medieval European cathedrals also 
                incorporated symbolic geometry. Indian and Himalayan 
                spiritual communities often constructed temples and 
                fortifications on design plans of mandala and yantra. 
                Mandala Vaatikas or Sacred Gardens were designed using 
                the same principles.Many of the sacred geometry principles 
                of the human body and of ancient architecture were compiled 
                into the Vitruvian Man drawing by Leonardo da Vinci. The 
                latter drawing was itself based on the much older writings 
                of the Roman architect Vitruvius.
