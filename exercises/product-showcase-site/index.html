                <p>Rudraksha beads, derived from the Rudraksha tree, hold deep
                    spiritual significance in Hindu culture. They are known to
                    enhance clarity, intuition, and spiritual connection. The
                    Om symbol, representing the cosmic sound and the essence
                    of the universe, adds an extra layer of sacredness to 
                    the pyramid.

                <p>Orgonites do not need all types of fancy colours, gemstones
                    or bling, just plain crystal quartz, metal & resin 
                    (in correct ratio). The most simple, basic and effective 
                    orgonite is really as simple as: Put a raw quartz crystal 
                    stone in a mould. Cover it with metal shavings (often 
                    referred to as swarf).
                </p>

                <p>Pyramids have been used for centuries to amplify and 
                    transform energy. The Orgone Pyramid cleans energy from a 
                    room, enhances energy levels and assists in feeling better
                    overall. Its mystical shape intensifies energy at its
                    point and grounds it at the base and boosts crystal 
                    healing properties.
