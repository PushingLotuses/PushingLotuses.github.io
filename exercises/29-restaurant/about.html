                        <hr>
                        Yepaâ€™s<br> began as a food truck in 2021 the heart of 
                        Downtown Miami. After three years of success, we 
                        established a brick & mortar location 
                        In the Famous Art Distric in 2025.
                       
                        It's not a bad deal at all for $10: Choice of 2 of 3 
                        internationally-styled sliders, soda and fries. The 
                        trio offered: American (American cheese, bacon); 
                        Italian (mozzarella cheese, basil, tomato); and French
                        (brie, honey, chopped almonds). I chose the first two,
                        both fat, juicy, and pretty tasty. Fries were cooked
                        in less-than-fresh oil. Soda was cold. There are 
                        better burgers around but not many better deals. 
                        But why doesn't The Latin House Grill offer some
                        sort of Latin burger? Not enough Hispanics in 
                        Miami? While they're at it, they might consider 
                        posting some sort of menu, too. A lot of folks 
                        left because they couldn't figure out what was 
                        being served.

                        Another night, another meals-on-wheels spectacle. 
                        This one took place last evening behind the Publix
                        at Biscayne Boulevard and 47th Street -- a temporary 
                        move from 81st Street due to some hiccup that is
                        apparently being solved. The crowds were thin 
                        relative to recent round-ups, perhaps due to the 
                        air having a bit of nip to it; plus I left before 
                        8 p.m., so maybe things got busier later on. What 
                        follows are photos of some of the foods sampled, 
                        with quick impressions of each. It's not good 
                        enough to be photo journalism, but how about we 
                        call it photo blogism?
