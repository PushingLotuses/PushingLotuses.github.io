                        A Clockwork Orange is a 1971 dystopian crime film adapted, 
                        produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on 
                        Anthony Burgess's 1962 novel. It employs disturbing 
                        and violent themes to comment on psychiatry, juvenile 
                        delinquency, youth gangs, and other social, political, 
                        and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.
                        Dowell), the central character, is a charismatic,[5] 
                        anti-social delinquent whose interests include classical 
                        music (especially that of Beethoven), committing rape, 
                        theft, and "ultra-violence". He leads a small gang of 
                        thugs, Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus), 
                        and Dim (Warren Clarke), whom he calls his droogs 
                        (from the Russian word друг, which is "friend", "buddy"). 
                        The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, 
                        his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an 
                        experimental psychological conditioning technique 
                        (the "Ludovico Technique") promoted by the Minister 
                        of the Interior (Anthony Sharp). Alex narrates most of 
                        the film in Nadsat, a fractured adolescent slang composed
                        of Slavic languages (especially Russian), English, and 
                        Cockney rhyming slang.

                <h3>Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    In a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is leader of a gang 
                    of "droogs": Georgie, Dim, and Pete. They engage in an 
                    intoxicated evening of "ultra-violence", which includes 
                    beating a vagrant and fighting a rival gang. They beat 
                    writer Frank Alexander to the point of crippling him, 
                    and Alex rapes Frank's wife while singing "Singin' in the 
                    Rain". The next day Alex's probation officer, P. R. 
                    Deltoid, cautions him.

                    Alex's droogs are not content with petty crime and want 
                    more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his
                    authority by attacking them. Alex invades the home of a 
                    wealthy "cat-lady" and bludgeons her with a phallic
                    sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing 
                    sirens, Alex tries to flee, but Dim smashes a bottle in 
                    his face and leaves him to be arrested. The woman dies
                    of her injuries, and Alex is sentenced to 14 years prison
                    for murder.

                            Kubrick's film is relatively faithful to the Burgess novel,
                            omitting only the final, positive chapter, in which Alex
                            matures and outgrows sociopathy. While the film ends with 
                            Alex being offered an open-ended government job, implying
                            he remains a sociopath at heart, the novel ends with 
                            Alex's positive change in character. This plot 
                            discrepancy occurred because Kubrick based his 
                            screenplay on the novel's American edition, in 
                            which the final chapter had been deleted on the 
                            insistence of its American publisher.[16] He claimed 
                            not to have read the complete, original version of the 
                            novel until he had almost finished writing the 
                            screenplay, and that he never considered using it.
                            [citation needed] The introduction to the 1996 
                            edition of A Clockwork Orange says that Kubrick 
                            found the end of the original edition too blandly 
                            optimistic and unrealistic.

                    <h3></h3>
                    <p>
                        In the novel, F. Alexander recognises Alex through several 
                        careless references to the previous attack (such as his wife 
                        then claiming they did not have a telephone). In the film, 
                        Alex is recognised when singing the song 'Singing in the 
                        Rain' in the bath, which he had hauntingly done while attacking
                         F. Alexander's wife. The song does not appear at all in the 
                         book, as it was an improvisation by actor Malcolm McDowell 
                         when Kubrick asked him if he could dance on the fifth day 
                         of filming the scene, after complaining that the rape scene 
                         was too "stiff". McDowell picked 'Singing in the Rain' 
                         because it was the only song he "sort of knew half the lyrics 
                         to"
        
                        Alex's droogs are not content with petty crime and want 
                        more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his
                        authority by attacking them. Alex invades the home of a 
                        wealthy "cat-lady" and bludgeons her with a phallic
                        sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing 
                        sirens, Alex tries to flee, but Dim smashes a bottle in 
                        his face and leaves him to be arrested. The woman dies
                        of her injuries, and Alex is sentenced to 14 years prison
                        for murder.
